      "message": "This is an area that could use some examination.  Your change removed the \"src/test/java\" source folder, which I\u0027ve also seen Eclipse randomly remove several times.  I think it may be a convention thing for PDE projects (putting everything in \"src\" instead of \"src/main/java\" and \"src/test/java\", being the typical Maven convention).  I did this because I was trying to have a \"pure\" (non-Tycho) unit test, which seems to be hard to do. You\u0027ll probably notice some of the odd things that I did in this particular plugin project to manage this.\n\nAlso, I don\u0027t understand the difference for the JRE_CONTAINER property change.",
